# Notes on running the commands
- System: ARM CPU, Single NVIDIA GPU GB10, cuda capability 12.1. System has CUDA 13.
- use --quantization flag (modelopt_fp8 or modelopt_fp4) to fix the quantization issue
- use --mem-fraction-static 0.7 --disable-cuda-graph to avoid out of memory (ninja compiling kernel)
- If there are previous attempts, learn from them and construct a new docker command.
